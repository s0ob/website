			<h2 class="mg">Summary</h2>
                        <p>This game uses an engine developed by Niantic, formerly a group that was once inside Google but is now independent, collaborating with Google, GAME FREAK, Creatures Inc., Nintendo, and more. This game was built the same engine that Ingress is run on. It uses Google Maps to map the world and place both you and game elements on a real world map in your phone.
                           Pokemon GO is a worldwide game, active everywhere on our planet. You can catch Pokemon anywhere there's a human population.
                          This game uses landmarks of many types for caches of items you can grab when you get close enough. Physically, that is. This game requires you to actually be within around 100-feet of Pokemon, PokeStops, or Pokemon Gyms to interact with them.</p>
                        <h2 class="mg">Gameplay</h2>
                        <p>Pokemon GO is a game you play on your smartphone - Android or iPhone. You sign up and pick a nickname for yourself and you're given a few items with which to capture and take care of Pokemon.Your job is to capture Pokemon and use them to battle other people like yourself using these creatures as warrior minions. It sounds worse than it is. In the game it's not at all violent, and the vast majority of the game has more to do with finding Pokemon than it does with battling them against your opponents.</p>
